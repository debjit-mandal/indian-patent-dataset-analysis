# Indian Patent Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing and visualizing the Indian Patent Dataset for the years 2010, 2011, and 2019. The project aims to provide insights into patent filings in India, facilitate academic research, ensure legal and regulatory compliance, and support predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The Indian Patent Dataset Analysis project includes several Jupyter Notebooks that cover different aspects of the dataset:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Visualization**
3. **Predictive Modeling**
4. **Research and Policy Analysis**
5. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
6. **Academic Research**

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed information about each patent application filed in India, including:
- Application Number
- Title
- Application Date
- Status
- Publication Number
- Publication Date
- Field Of Invention
- Classification (IPC)
- Inventor Information
- Applicant Information
- Priority Country
- Request for Examination Date
- First Examination Report Date
- Date Of Certificate Issue
- Post Grant Journal Date
- Reply to FER Date
- PCT International Application Number
- PCT International Filing Date
- Application Status

## Notebooks

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Provides an initial exploration of the dataset, including data cleaning, feature extraction, and basic statistics.

### 2. Visualization
Includes detailed visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and heatmaps to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
Builds and evaluates predictive models to forecast future trends or classify patents, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### 4. Research and Policy Analysis
Provides insights for research, policy-making, and business intelligence by analyzing the impact of patents in different fields of invention, trends in patent filings, and the time taken from application to approval.

### 5. Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Ensures that the data complies with legal and regulatory requirements by analyzing the status of patents, tracking changes in patent laws and regulations, and studying the distribution of patents by applicant type.

### 6. Academic Research
Enables academic research on innovation, technology transfer, and other related topics by studying innovation patterns in different industries, analyzing the impact of patents on technology transfer, and conducting case studies on specific patents or groups of patents.
